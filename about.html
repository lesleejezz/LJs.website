        <p style="font-size: 20px">Hello there! My name is Leslee Jezzel Buot. But you can call me "Leslee" in short. 
        I prefer to be called by my first name rather than my second or last name. I am 19 years old 
        and was born on March 5, 2004, Cebu City. My hobbies include reading comics/manga, 
        watching anime, listening to music, and playing mobile games. I am currently living with my family
        here in Bulacao, Cebu City. In the family, I have two siblings, which makes me the middle child. 
        I am in my school years, studying my first year as a BSIT student at CIT-U. Though I may be inexperienced 
        in making CSS or programming-related content, I am eager and willing to learn about this topic. 
        So, I look forward to finally making my own program. I chose this course field because I find it interesting, 
        but to be honest, I am more into blue-collar jobs such as installing computer PCs or working in a factory company 
        that relates to electronics, and etc. But one thing is for sure, I have always dreamed of having a computer cafe business. 
        My only goal for now is to survive this semester and learn a single programming language before I reach my second year. 
        And lastly, my ideal career is to become a web developer or do any electronic-related job that pays a high salary.
